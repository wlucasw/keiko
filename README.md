# Keiko Pokemon

## Prerequisites

- `NodeJS` v14+ installed
- `yarn` installed globally (`npm install -g yarn`)

## Installation

Install the backend dependencies:

```bash
cd backend && yarn
```

Install the frontend dependencies

```bash
cd frontend && yarn
```

You are good to go !

## Running the project

- Open two different terminals (one for the backend and the other the frontend)
- In the first terminal, start the backend by running:
```bash
cd backend && yarn start
```

Check that the backend is running by visiting: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). A website should appear with some API docs.

- In the second terminal, start the frontend by running:
```bash
cd frontend && yarn start
```

Check that the frontend is running by visiting: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Development

This project supports hot reloading. Each time a file is modified in the frontend, the server will automatically reload the required code.
